        <p style="text-align:center;">Every single death on this list is historically significant.<br><br>Every death implies the interruption of a life, and every life is historically significant.<br></p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Each life might only have as much affect as a butterfly's wing flaps, but that one seasonal farmhand's death can have tremendous impact on the GDP of a country across the world a century later. Someone sparked the arab spring risings through a social media post. They caused change for a huge region of the world. On the flip side, Charlemagne did a great deal in his life, uniting most of Europe under one throne, yet his demense was split to pieces after his death, pieces that further fragmented and went ununited until the German Reich during World War II. Is it possible to determine whether a death is significant without preventing the death and waiting a few thousand years to determine the consequences.<br><br>Life impacts history, ergo every death is significant.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;">Order Justification</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Unfortunately, deaths are not easily ranked. Impact is not measureable, there is no logical ranking numver such as reach or age, therefore the list has been ranked by inspired humor and awe in the creator. In the event of a revisiting of this list, it would likely be entirely different, as many of the decisions were based on factors with sources beyond my perception.<br>I suppose this is more of an antijustification, a justification of my lack of a justification.</p>
